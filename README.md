# TilePlatformerGame

## A mario style side scrolling platformer using Love2D

A work in progress, join Portos on his quest to retrieve the bones. I have created a level maker and hope to develop the game to follow a narrative and include boss fights.

It is easy to create, test and save levels locally using the tool, it would be nice to have an easy way to share save files too.

I decided having the option to traverse both upwards and forwards might lead to interesting scenarios. I think there is potential for airborne escapades and of course it gives level builders more creative freedom.
